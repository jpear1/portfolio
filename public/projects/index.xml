      <description>Noisemaker is a basic music synthesizer written in C++. It&amp;rsquo;s capable of additive and frequency modulation synthesis techniques. I wrote this while reading Computer Music: Synthesis, Composition, and Performance by Charles Dodge, which was super interesting. If you&amp;rsquo;re at all interested in digital synthesis, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend taking a look at it. The basics of how a synthesizer works are explained, but if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in exactly how these techniqutes are implemented in a general purpose programming language, you may find it informative to take a look at Noisemaker.</description>

      <description>The programmable music box is a project I wrote software for at the Dos Pueblos Engineering academy in my senior year of high school with one other student.
A bare music box
 Normal music boxes are built so that each columns of pins can only play one note. This is because the tines that are plucked by each column have a fixed length.
The programmable music box allows users to create their own tune on a music box.</description>

      <description>The Self-Playing Guitar, or sometimes the Air Guitar, is a project I programmed and partially built with two other students at the Dos Pueblos Engineering Academy in my senior year of high school.
A guitarist performing a hammer-on
 The project is actually a lot more than just a guitar; it has a carriage of pneumatic pistons that act as the &amp;ldquo;fingers&amp;rdquo; that play the guitar, which use a technique called a hammer-on (when a player slams their finger down on the string hard enough that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to strum).</description>
