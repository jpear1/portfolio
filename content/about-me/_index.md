My name is Jack Pearson. I'm studying Computing (Computer Science under a different name) at UCSB. Right now, I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2021 in software development. My main areas of expertise are web development, C++ applications, and Python scripts. I've been writing programs in some form since 7th grade, but I didn't start working on large projects until my senior year of high school, when I discovered that I really enjoyed programming and decided it would be my career.

My work ethic can be described as "completionist". So, in video games, this means that I have to get every achievement and finish every quest before I'm happy. Similarly, when I'm doing software development, I strive to thouroughly understand every part of what I'm building, design it according to whatever common practices I can find, then document it.

I also enjoy teaching. Being a "completionist", I like to test and cement my knowledge by teaching it to others, and teaching tends comes pretty naturally to me. Plus, I feel like I'm doing a good thing. I've given a lecture on C++ to my intro to CS class, volunteered as a physics tutor, help English learners on HiNative where I'm a [top rated answerer](https://hinative.com/en-US/profiles/5766278), and I visit subreddits for learners of topics that I know well (learnmath, learnjapanese, techsupport).

In my free time, I like to continue learning. I've been studying Japanese for a couple years now, and, interested by some of the rabbit holes I went down when learning Japanese, also recently started studying linguistics. I sing (poorly) and play piano (a little less poorly). Through some pretty awesome coincidences, I've had the opportunity to sing in a choir for the Santa Barbara Orchestra a couple of times.
