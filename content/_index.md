I'm college student with a passion for contributing to open source projects.

I've done programming for a variety of open source projects, including
websites, a desktop application, a Python plugin, and random shell scripts. I
also enjoy contributing information to open documentation and data collection
projects when I can (like Wikipedia, Mozilla Common Voice, etc.).

A few of my other hobbies include music, Japanese, linguistics, camping, and
teaching.

You can read about some of my programming projects I've written about under the
"Projects" tab, and you can read more about how I spend my time under "About
Me."
