  <h1>Self-Playing Guitar</h1>
  <p>The Self-Playing Guitar, or sometimes the Air Guitar, is a project I
programmed and partially built with two other students at the Dos Pueblos
Engineering Academy in my senior year of high school.</p>
<figure class="float-right w-25 ml-4">
  <img class="shadow-image w-100"
    src="/projects/guitar/images/hammer-on.jpg">
  <p class="text-right caption">A guitarist performing a hammer-on</p>
</figure>

<p>The project is actually a lot more than just a guitar; it has a carriage of
pneumatic pistons that act as the &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; that play the guitar, which use a
technique called a hammer-on (when a player slams their finger down on the
string hard enough that they don&rsquo;t have to strum). The pistons are controlled
by an Arduino, which is in turn controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which also
controls the motor and displays the GUI.</p>
<p>The guitar has a library of music in MIDI format that it knows how to play. It
picks out the guitar part of the song, uses a pathfinding algorithm to figure
out how to play it efficiently, and plays the other parts using a synthesizer.
This pathfinding algorithm was written by one of my very talented teammates,
and I wrote a routine that used some music theory to simplify parts of a song
when the guitar was unable to find a way to play it.</p>
<p>The user can pick which song they want to hear, then once it&rsquo;s playing, control
the guitar in the same way they would control a music player like Spotify. They
can pause, play, stop, and fast forward/rewind. An animation of the piston and
motor movements is also displayed, as it&rsquo;s often difficult to see exactly what
the pistons are doing.  All of this is written in Python, using Kivy for
graphics.</p>
<p>My main role was writing the user interface, but because my team inherited the
unfinished guitar from older students and none of us were on the &ldquo;mechanical
team&rdquo;, I often ended up doing some mechanical engineering too.  Using
SolidWorks, I designed things like: part of a re-imagined piston carriage,
plates to protect the electrical components from people, and plates to protect
people from the (20A, very powerful) motorized carriage. I also often
machined/laser cut such parts in our machine shop.</p>
<p>A point of pride for my team was our organized electrical setup. Our final
product was something like rev. 4 of the setup. We all became intimately
familiar with the smell of solder.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a mini video tour of the guitar playing a couple songs, sans-synth:</p>
