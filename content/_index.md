I'm a sophomore at UCSB studying Computing with a passion for contributing to
open source projects.

I've done programming for a variety of open source projects, including
websites, a desktop application, a Python plugin, and random bash scripts. I
also enjoy contributing information to open documentation and data collection
projects when I can (like Wikipedia, Mozilla Common Voice, etc.).

A few of my other hobbies include music, Japanese, linguistics, camping, and
teaching.

You can read more about my programming projects under the "Projects" tab
(currently under construction), and you can read more about my other interests
and activites under "About Me." (also doesn't exist yet)
