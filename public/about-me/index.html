    <p>My name is Jack Pearson. I&rsquo;m studying Computing (Computer Science under a different name) at UCSB. Right now, I&rsquo;m looking for an internship for Summer 2021 in software development. My main areas of expertise are web development, C++ applications, and Python scripts. I&rsquo;ve been writing programs in some form since 7th grade, but I didn&rsquo;t start working on large projects until my senior year of high school, when I discovered that I really enjoyed programming and decided it would be my career.</p>
<p>My work ethic can be described as &ldquo;completionist&rdquo;. So, in video games, this means that I have to get every achievement and finish every quest before I&rsquo;m happy. Similarly, when I&rsquo;m doing software development, I strive to thouroughly understand every part of what I&rsquo;m building, design it according to whatever common practices I can find, then document it.</p>
<p>I also enjoy teaching. Being a &ldquo;completionist&rdquo;, I like to test and cement my knowledge by teaching it to others, and teaching tends comes pretty naturally to me. Plus, I feel like I&rsquo;m doing a good thing. I&rsquo;ve given a lecture to my intro to CS class, volunteered as a physics tutor, help English learners on HiNative where I&rsquo;m a <a href="https://hinative.com/en-US/profiles/5766278">top rated answerer</a>, and I visit subreddits for learners of topics that I know well (learnmath, learnjapanese, techsupport).</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to continue learning. I&rsquo;ve been studying Japanese for a couple years now, and, interested by some of the rabbit holes I went down when learning Japanese, also recently started studying linguistics. I sing (poorly) and play piano (a little less poorly). Through some pretty awesome coincidences, I&rsquo;ve had the opportunity to sing in a choir for the Santa Barbara Orchestra a couple of times.</p>
