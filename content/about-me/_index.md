My name is Jack Pearson. I'm a sophomore at UCSB studying Computing (Computer
Science under a different name), and right now I'm looking for a software
development internship in Summer 2021. The main areas I have experience in are
web development, C++ applications, and Python (my language of choice for
anything algorithm-ey). I'm the guy in the middle left of the above photo with
the "Jack Pearson" nametag, trying to convince a parent that my project is
interesting.

Here's a couple things you may want to know about me before you work with me:

- I tend to be very thorough. I'm not really happy with a program until I've
  understood every part of it, ensured it's reasonably consistent with common
  practices, and written some solid documentation.

- I enjoy tinkering with my tools. I have no idea how many hours I've spent
  fine tuning vim and my other rc files.

I also enjoy teaching, partially because I like to test and cement my
knowledge, and partially because it just makes me feel good. I've given a
lecture on C++ to my intro to CS class, volunteered as a physics tutor, I help
English learners on HiNative where I'm a [top rated answerer], and I visit
subreddits for learners of topics that I know well (learnmath, learnjapanese,
techsupport).

In my free time, I like to continue learning. I've been studying Japanese for a
couple years now, and, interested by some of the rabbit holes I went down when
learning Japanese, also recently started studying linguistics. I sing (poorly)
and play piano (a little less poorly). Through two separate series of
~~fortunate~~ unfortunate events, I've had the opportunity to sing in a choir
with the Santa Barbara Orchestra a couple of times.

I love discussing things I know about (and don't know about), so if you want to
talk to me about anything, business or otherwise, feel free to contact me via
email at:\
